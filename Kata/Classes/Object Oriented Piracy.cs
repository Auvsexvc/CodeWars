    /// Ahoy matey!
    /// You are a leader of a small pirate crew.And you have a plan.With the help of OOP you wish to make a pretty efficient system to identify ships with a heavy booty on board.
    /// Unfortunattely for you, people weigh a lot this days, so how do you know if a ship if full of gold and not people?
    /// Every time your spies see a new ship enter the dock, they will create a new ship object based on their observations:
    ///draft - an estimate of the ship's weight based on how low it is in the water
    ///crew - the count of crew on board
    ///Ship titanic = new Ship(15, 10);
    ///Taking into account that an average crew member on board adds 1.5 units to the draft, a ship that has a draft of more than 20 without crew is considered worthy to loot.Any ship weighing that much must have a lot of booty!
    ///    Add the method
    ///    IsWorthIt
    ///    to decide if the ship is worthy to loot.For example:
    ///    titanic.IsWorthIt() => false
    /// This Kata teaches you the very basic of method creation.
    ///   Good luck!
