    ///  Task: Create a class Vector3D
    ///  Properties: X, Y, Z and Length as double and public scope and accessors
    ///  X, Y and Z will be set by test methods
    ///  Length should only have an get-accessor which calculates the vector's length
    ///  ##Some references, to get into the topic
    ///  The length or magnitude or norm of the vector a is denoted by ‖a‖ or, less commonly, |a|, which is not to be confused with the absolute value(a scalar "norm").
    ///  The length of the vector a can be computed with the Euclidean norm
    ///  How to calculate a vector's length - Link created 2016/11/15
    ///  ##Tests
    ///  Final tests include 2 fixed and 125 random tests.They will look like this:
    ///  double length = new Vector3D()
    ///  {
    ///      X = 0,
    ///      Y = 0,
    ///      Z = 2
    ///  }.Length;
    ///      length == 2 ///   true
